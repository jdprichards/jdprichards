                            I am Joe first class Computer Games Development Graduate with a focus in Unreal Engine and Engine Development in C++.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            Final Third year project was to create a Physics and Collision Detection Engine in C++ using Microsofts DirectX 11,
                            which I'm currently working on rewriting from the ground-up to expand and incoporate new features.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            I am currently applying for jobs in both the computer games industry and software development. While working on projects and expanding on 
                            my skills set. My main project at the moment is to expand on my Physics Engine to incoporate better graphics and post-processing techniques.
                            <br/>
                            Outside of the workplace I have a love for bouldering where I was apart of a society during my university years that did climbing and other outdoors activities 
                            on a regular basis which I continue to do.
